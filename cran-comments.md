## Resubmission

I have added a 'SystemRequirements' field which explicitly states that
the package requires ADMIXTOOLS command-line utilities compiled on the
system. It also includes a link to where the user can find the most
recent information on how to install the ADMIXTOOLS software.

## Checked environments

* My local macOS install: R 4.0.1
* Ubuntu 16.04 GNU/Linux (on Travis CI): R 4.0.0
* Windows (on https://win-builder.r-project.org/): R-devel, R 4.0.2

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs and no WARNINGs.

There was only one NOTE ("New submission").

## Downstream dependencies

None.
