## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of my first attempt to submit the package.

In this version I have:

* Added single quotes around 'ADMIXTOOLS' in the Title and Description fields
  as requested.

* Removed the reduntant "directly from R" from the Title as requested.

* Added a URL to the ADMIXTOOLS software to the Description as suggested.

## Test environments

* My local macOS install: R 4.0.1
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (on Travis CI): R 4.0.0
* Windows (on https://win-builder.r-project.org/): R-devel, R 4.0.0

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs and no WARNINGs.

There was only one NOTE ("New submission").

## Downstream dependencies

None.
