Description: An interface for various command-line tools provided by the
    software suite 'ADMIXTOOLS' (<https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools>).
    Wrapper functions completely automate the generation of intermediate
    configuration files, run 'ADMIXTOOLS' programs on the command-line in
    the background, and extract statistics of interest from plain-text files
    which they produce. This allows users to avoid dealing with low-level
    technical details of shell scripting (which is requried by traditional
    'ADMIXTOOLS' workflows) and focus on their research problem at hand instead.
    A set of complementary functions for processing and filtering of data in
    the 'EIGENSTRAT' format is also provided.
