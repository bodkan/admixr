Description: An interface for performing all stages of 'ADMIXTOOLS' analyses
    (<https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/software>) entirely from R. Wrapper functions
    (D, f4, f3, etc.) completely automate the generation of intermediate
    configuration files, run 'ADMIXTOOLS' programs on the command-line, and
    parse output files to extract values of interest. This allows users to focus
    on the analysis itself instead of worrying about low-level technical details.
    A set of complementary functions for processing and filtering of data in
    the 'EIGENSTRAT' format is also provided.
