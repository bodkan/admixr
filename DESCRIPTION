Description: A convenient interface for performing all stages of ADMIXTOOLS
    analyses entirely from R. Wrapper functions (D, f4, f3, etc.) completely
    automate the generation of intermediate configuration files, run ADMIXTOOLS
    programs on the command-line, and parse output files to extract values of
    interest. This allows users to focus on the analysis itself instead of
    worrying about low-level technical details. A set of complementary
    functions for processing and filtering of data in the EIGENSTRAT format is
    also provided.
