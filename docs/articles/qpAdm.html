<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>qpAdm model fitting is a complex topic. Navigating it successfuly requires solid knowledge of the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>-statistics theory first introduced by Nick Patterson and colleagues <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065">in 2012</a>. As part of our <a href="tutorial.html#qpwave-and-qpadm-1">tutorial</a>, we have looked at a very basic overview of the qpAdm-related functionality implemented in <em>admixr</em> and also talked about some important resources for learning more the method pioneered by Iosif Lazaridis in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317">2015</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, Harney <em>et al.</em> published an exciting new preprint called <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.032664v1">“Assessing the Performance of qpAdm: A Statistical Tool for Studying Population Admixture”</a>. Before we go any further, I encourage everyone to read it and the superb tutorial/guide available as its <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.032664v1.supplementary-material">supplementary pdf</a> on bioRxiv. There really isn’t a better source of information on how to run and interpret qpAdm analyses.</p>
<p>Please, only attempt to run qpAdm if you have familiarized yoursef with all of the above-mentioned resources. I have had many people ask questions via email (not only about qpAdm but also other topics) to which the only sensible answer was - “you have to read the papers and understand the statistics first.” I know it’s frustrating but there really are no shortcuts here.</p>

<div id="qpadm-rotation" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#qpadm-rotation" class="anchor"></a><em>qpAdm</em> “rotation”</h2>
<p>If you have ever worked with <em>qpAdm</em>, you are well aware of the intricacies of finding the most suitable set of models that can explain the data. Among other things, we have to make a decision about the number of admixture sources and which populations are the most appropriate surrogates for those source populations (because only rarely we have sampled them directly). Furthermore, we need to carefully choose a number of so called ‘outgroup’ populations (also called ‘references’ or ‘right’ populations, depending on whom you talk to).</p>
<p>The preprint by <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.032664v1">Harney <em>et al.</em></a> described an interesting idea to find a set of the most appropriate models (i.e. combinations of source and outgroup populations) which has been sucessfully used in the past. They call the method a “rotating population” strategy.</p>
<p>This approach starts by defining a set of “candidate” populations from which we iteratively sample a defined number of “sources” of ancestry for our “target” population of interest (most commonly two or three sources). After removing the sources from the candidate list, we then define all the remaining populations as “outgroups”. Finally, we iteratively fit qpAdm models for each combination of target, sources and outgroups, extracting <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values and other statistics of interest. After finishing the exhaustive fitting of source-outgroup combinations, we examine all explored models, selecting those that seem most appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation-in-admixr" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#implementation-in-admixr" class="anchor"></a>Implementation in <em>admixr</em>
</h2>
<p>In <em>admixr</em>, I have implemented a function <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation()</a></code> which does exactly what is described paragraph with one additional feature. Given the sensitivity of <em>qpAdm</em> to large numbers of potential outgroups (references), for each combination of sources and outgroups we also explore models for all possible <em>subsets</em> of outgroups. This is to find models which are as small as possible, possibly determining which outgroups are potentially redundant and not actually needed.</p>
<p>Let’s say that we have a target population <em>T</em> and a set of candidates for potential sources and outgroups <em>C</em> = {a, b, c, d, e, f}. Then, if we imagine an iteration of the rotation scheme in which we fixed sources <em>S</em> = {a, b}, we have remaining candidates for outgroups <em>C - S</em> = {c, d, e, f}. The basic implementation of the rotation procedure would simply take <em>C - S</em> as the full set of outgroups and fitted the following model:</p>
<ul>
<li>model #1: target <em>T</em>, sources <em>S</em> = {a, b} and outgroups = {c, d, e, f}</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in <em>admixr</em>, we would evaluate the following models in addition to the model #1:</p>
<ul>
<li>model #2: target <em>T</em>, sources <em>S</em> = {a, b} and outgroups = {c, d, e}</li>
<li>model #3: target <em>T</em>, sources <em>S</em> = {a, b} and outgroups = {c, d, f}</li>
<li>model #4: target <em>T</em>, sources <em>S</em> = {a, b} and outgroups = {c, e, f}</li>
<li>model #5: target <em>T</em>, sources <em>S</em> = {a, b} and outgroups = {d, e, f}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, our implementation in <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation()</a></code> explores all posible outgroup combinations, allowing us to look for the <em>smallest</em> model (in terms of outgroup size) that can explain our data.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s revisit the problem of estimating the level of Neandertal ancestry in a French person from the main tutorial. We use this as an illustration because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s the simplest possible analysis one could do with <em>qpAdm</em>.</li>
<li>It gives us a clear expectation of what the “truth” is.</li>
<li>It gives us a clear expectation of what models we should <em>definitely</em> reject.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, let’s download and install a development version of <em>admixr</em> to get access to the new features, and download a small example data set:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="co"># install `devtools` if not on already your system by running:</span>
<span class="co"># install.packages("devtools")</span>
<span class="co"># this will allow installing 'admixr' from Github</span>
<span class="co">#devtools::install_github("bodkan/admixr", ref = "qpadm-rotation", force = TRUE)</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">admixr</span>)

<span class="no">snps</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/eigenstrat.html">eigenstrat</a></span>(<span class="fu"><a href="../reference/download_data.html">download_data</a></span>())</pre></body></html></div>
<p>These are the individuals for which we have genotype data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_ind.html">read_ind</a></span>(<span class="no">snps</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation()</a></code> function is very simple. It accepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a name of the target population,</li>
<li>a list of candidate populations,</li>
<li>a logical parameter <code>minimize</code>, determining whether to perform the “minimization” of the outgroup size described in the previous section,</li>
<li>the assumed number of sources of ancestry,</li>
<li>the number of CPU cores to use for analysis (be careful with this options as many ADMIXTOOLS analyses run in parallel can consume <em>a lot</em> of memory!),</li>
<li>parameter <code>fulloutput</code> specifying whether we want to have all the “ranks” and “subsets/patterns” statistics (see the main tutorial for more information) or if we just want the proportions of ancestry and significance values for individual models (this is the default, i.e. <code>fulloutput = FALSE</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s say we are interested in finding the proportions of archaic human ancestry in a French individual, and we also want to see what sorts of possible models we could find that match archaic introgression. We would run the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">models</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation</a></span>(

    <span class="kw">fulloutput</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">TRUE</span>
)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Here is what the full output looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">models</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p>We can see a list with three components, as we would expect from any other <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm.html">qpAdm()</a></code> run (again, see the manual page and the tutorial for description of all three elements and their meaning). The first column of each component is always named <code>model</code> - this contains a short identifier of each individual “rotation” run (i.e., a combination target &amp; sources &amp; outgroups). It’s values don’t have any particular meaning - the order is completely arbitrary!, This variable is useful for later filtering and examination of individual models in detail.</p>
<p>Let’s ignore the <code>$ranks</code> and <code>$subsets</code> elements for now. We will focus only on the first element, <code>$proportions</code> which contains the main <em>qpAdm</em> summary.</p>
</div>
<div id="examining-and-filtering-fitted-models" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#examining-and-filtering-fitted-models" class="anchor"></a>Examining and filtering fitted models</h3>
<p>The <code>$proportions</code> table shown above contains information about <em>all</em> models, regardless of their plausibility. We can see that by examining the distributions of p-values (column <code>pvalue</code>) and admixture proportions (columns <code>prop1</code> and <code>prop2</code>) of each evaluated model in the figure below.</p>
<p>Notice two things (each dot represents one examined <em>qpAdm</em> model):</p>
<ul>
<li>Many models have inferred admixture proportions <em>way</em> outside the [0, 1] interval - those are clearly nonsensical.</li>
<li>Many models have very low p-values - this means these are incompatible with the data and can be rejected.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make it easier to narrow down the list of all models, <em>admixr</em> package contains a function <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_filter.html">qpAdm_filter()</a></code>. This function accepts the result of the <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation()</a></code> function (either the <code>fulloutput = TRUE</code> version or the simple data frame with admixture proportions, p-values etc. produced by using<code>fulloutput = FALSE</code>) and filters out models with any of the proportions outside of the [0, 1] range and with p-values lower than a specified cutoff (0.05 by default):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="co"># filter out models which can clearly be rejected</span>
<span class="no">fits</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/qpAdm_filter.html">qpAdm_filter</a></span>(<span class="no">models</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>We can verify that the filtering worked by visualizing the filtered set of models again. Note that the p-values are distributed across the range of “insigificance” (i.e., “non-rejection”) between [0.05, 1.0]. Furthermore - remember that we originally set out to find combinations of sources-outgroups that model archaic ancestry in a French individual? We can clearly see two tidy clusters of estimated ancestry proportions. One is very small (this corresponds to the Neandertal component in modern humans - we would expect about 2-3% based on many previous analyses) and one large (“modern human” component, non-Neandertal ancestry):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="no">fits</span>$<span class="no">proportions</span>, <span class="no">model</span>, <span class="no">pvalue</span>, <span class="no">prop1</span>, <span class="no">prop2</span>) <span class="kw">%&gt;%</span>

<p>Let’s now focus only on the proportions table. We will also ignore a couple of columns for brevity. Note that we are now also completely ignoring p-values because we <em>cannot</em> used those for model selection - they are <em>not</em> statistically meaningful at this stage! Higher p-value <em>never</em> implies higher likelihood of the model. Finally, we order the models based on the size of the outgroup set (smaller models first):</p>

<p>Fun fact: notice in the table below that there are many models in which the chimpanzee was fitted as a source of ancestry! Interestingly, qpAdm used Chimp to infer archaic human ancestry. This is because you could think of Neandertal ancestry as an “ancestral component” of a modern human genome and the <em>qpAdm</em> rotation procedure therefore concludes that Chimpanzee is not be an unreasonable surrogate for a source population. Of course, we know there are better sources in our candidates set - we have the archaic humans!</p>

<p>Another interesting fact: notice that the rotating population procedure selected another plausible model characterizing the ancestry of the French individual. However, this of course doesn’t represent Neandertal introgression. What it might possibly represent is left as an exercise for the reader… :)</p>

<p>At this stage of analysis, you would have to decide which of the models produced by <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_filter.html">qpAdm_filter()</a></code> that cannot be immediately rejected are more reasonable than others and why. Possibly based on both some prior knowledge and additional statistics (such as the details information available in the full log output information shown by <code><a href="../reference/loginfo.html">loginfo()</a></code>). You could say that the <em>qpAdm</em> methodology, while rooted in strong statistics, is from a certain point as much art as it is science. Interpreting the results and finding the most appropriate models can be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Happy modeling and please, do <a href="https://github.com/bodkan/admixr/issues">let me know</a> if you discover bugs or missing features. My goal with this tool is to streamline <em>qpAdm</em> model fitting as much as possible and I can do it only with your input.</p>

<li><p>As a reminder, keep in mind that <em>admixr</em> gives you tools for filtering SNPs and also grouping samples into populations on the fly! You can easily process and group samples before plugging them into <code><a href="../reference/qpAdm_rotation.html">qpAdm_rotation()</a></code>!</p></li>
<li><p>Also note that you can use the function <code><a href="../reference/loginfo.html">loginfo()</a></code> to examine the complete log output of any model by specifying the model identifier.
