# *admixr*: an R interface for the ADMIXTOOLS software

## What is *admixr*?

The *admixr* package provides a convenient R interface to
[ADMIXTOOLS](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/), a widely used
software package for calculating admixture statistics and testing
population admixture hypotheses.

A typical ADMIXTOOLS workflow often involves a combination of
`sed`/`awk`/shell scripting and manual editing to create different
configuration files. These are then passed as command-line arguments to
one of ADMIXTOOLS commands, and control how to run a particular
analysis. The results of such computation are then usually redirected to
another file, which needs to be parsed by the user to extract values of
interest, often using command-line utilities again or by manual
copy-pasting, and finally analysed in R, Excel or another program.

This workflow can be a little cumbersome, especially if one wants to
explore many hypotheses involving different combinations of populations
or data filtering strategies. Most importantly, it makes it difficult to
follow the rules of best practice for reproducible science, especially
given the need for manual intervention on the command-line or custom
shell scripting to orchestrate more complex pipelines.

*admixr* makes it possible to perform all stages of an ADMIXTOOLS
analysis entirely from R. It provides a [set of convenient
functions](https://bodkan.net/admixr/reference/index.html) that
completely remove the need for “low-level” configuration of individual
ADMIXTOOLS programs, allowing users to focus on the analysis itself.

## How to cite

*admixr* is now published as an [*Application
Note*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz030) in the journal
Bioinformatics. If you use it in your work, please cite the paper! You
will join an [excellent
company](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=13286994334855947290)
of papers who have used it to do amazing research. 🙂

## Installation instructions

#### Browser-based RStudio session

You can try out *admixr* without installation directly in your browser!
Simply click on
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/admixr/main?urlpath=rstudio)
and after a short moment you will get a Binder RStudio could session
running in your web browser. However, please note that Binder’s
computational resources are extremely limited so you might run into
issues if you try to run extremely resource-intensive computations.

#### Latest stable version

The package is available [on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=admixr). You can install it
simply by running

``` r

install.packages("admixr")
```

from your R session. This the recommended procedure for most users.

#### Development version

To install the development version from Github (which might be slightly
ahead in terms of new features and bugfixes compared to the stable
release on CRAN), you need the R package *devtools*. You can run:

``` r

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bodkan/admixr")
```

#### Installing ADMIXTOOLS

In order to use the *admixr* package, you need a working installation of
ADMIXTOOLS. You can find installation instructions
[here](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools/blob/master/README.INSTALL).

Furthermore, you also need to make sure that R can find ADMIXTOOLS
binaries on the `$PATH`. You can achieve this by specifying
`PATH=<path to the location of ADMIXTOOLS programs>` in the `.Renviron`
file in your home directory. If R cannot find ADMIXTOOLS utilities, you
will get a warning upon loading
[`library(admixr)`](https://github.com/bodkan/admixr) in your R session.

**In terms of the version of ADMIXTOOLS required by *admixr*, there is
no formal requirement. However, please note that the package is
generally developed and tested against the latest ADMIXTOOLS release
(which is currently version 8.0.2).**

## Example analysis

This is all the code that you need to perform ADMIXTOOLS analyses using
this package! No shell scripting, no copy-pasting and manual editing of
text files. The only thing you need is a working ADMIXTOOLS installation
and a path to EIGENSTRAT data (a trio of ind/snp/geno files), which we
call `prefix` here.

``` r

library(admixr)

# download a small testing dataset to a temporary directory and process it for use in R
snp_data <- eigenstrat(download_data())

result <- d(
  W = c("French", "Sardinian"), X = "Yoruba", Y = "Vindija", Z = "Chimp",
  data = snp_data
)

result
```

Note that a single call to the `d` function generates all required
intermediate config and population files, runs ADMIXTOOLS, parses its
log output and returns the result as a `data.frame` object with the D
statistics results. It does all of this behind the scenes, without the
user having to deal with low-level technical details.

## Is *admixr* related to ADMIXTOOLS 2?

Recently, a new R package called [ADMIXTOOLS
2](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/) appeared on the horizon,
offering a re-implementation of several features of the original
ADMIXTOOLS suite of command-line programs.

The *admixr* project is not related to that initiative. It is not a
pre-cursor to it, nor it is superseeded by it. I have never used
ADMIXTOOLS 2 myself, but from the looks of it it seems to offer some
very interesting features for fitting complex admixture graphs, which is
certainly something which *admixr* does not do.

**The bottom-line is this:** as long as the [original
ADMIXTOOLS](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools) continues to be
developed and maintained, *admixr* remains relevant and useful and will
continue to be supported. ADMIXTOOLS is one of the most battle-tested
pieces of software in population genetics—if you’re happy with the set
of features it provides and if you’re happy with *admixr* itself, there
is no real reason to move away from either of them.
